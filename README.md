# Smart Queuing System
This project is a computer vision application developed with Intel Distribution of OpenVINO. This application was developed to analyze the constraints, propose the hardware solution, and build out and test the application on the DEVCloud. The goal involved is to build an application to reduce congestion and queuing systems in three scenarios from three different industry sectors.

## Project tasks performed 

The following takes were perfomaned during this project execution:

Proposed a possible hardware solution
Built out your application and test its performance on the DevCloud using multiple hardware types
Compared the performance to see which hardware performed best
Revised your proposal based on the test results

The three scenarios that were performed:

Scenario 1: Manufacturing Sector
Scenario 2: Retail Sector
Scenario 3: Transportation Sector

The scenarios had specific constraints realated to the clients needs and budget.
